# Arduino-autonomous-car
Designed and programmed a 3DOF robotic arm using Arduino and servo motors. Implemented calibrated position control and inverse kinematics to compute joint angles for defined end-effector positions. Optimised timing control for improved responsiveness and repeatable motion sequencing.
